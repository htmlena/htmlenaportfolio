      <h1 class="heading">About me</h1>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        I was always interested in learning programming and I found courage back
        in 2019. I started with Python and practiced in my free time. Soon, I
        realized that I needed something more 'visual'.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        During pandemic, I quickly realized that the work as an HR coordinator
        didn't give me a feeling of fulfilment. I needed something more creative
        and this is when front-end development came to play. I decided to come
        back to programming again. This time starting with the #100daysofcode
        challenge to stay more accountable.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        I decided to learn HTML & CSS. I found a course on the Responsive Web
        Design on the freeCodeCamp and finally, it gave me the joy that my
        current jod didn't give me. I was coding every evening, creating simple
        web pages with HTML & CSS, finishing all the projects, fighting with
        Flexbox, Grid, learning basics of accessibility and visual design. I
        posted my thoughts and reported my progress on Instagram. Writing about
        the things I was learning helped me to structure my knowledge. This
        journey made me confident that web was my passion.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        Then I continued with a web development bootcamp on Udemy, where I
        practiced Bootstrap and continued to deepen my HTML & CSS knowledge. I
        also got first experience with JavaScript and decided to continue my
        coding adventure with Czechitas' Web Academy this time. At Czechitas'
        Web Academy, I deepen my knowledge in JavaScript, learn React, get to
        know Git, webpack, work with API and collaborate on various web
        projects, receive and give feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        At this point I understand well enough that programming is my big
        passion that I want to pursue. It gives me purpose and I'm having fun
        working on the projects.
      </p>
      <p class="about-me-text">
        Currently my main focus is on my JS and React skills, but I'd like to
        learn more about accessibility and UX principles in the future.
